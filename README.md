# Genetic Algorithms (GA)
GAs are algorithms used for optimization problems, where we want to maximize or minimize some sort of function. 

This repository has some exercises from my Genetic Algorithms (GA) classes. It has a Jupyter Notebook for each question, explaining the problem involved and the design of the operators uses in the algorithm, and a `.py` file, containing the script where I wrote my functions. Note that the functions were not created in the most optimal way, only being designed for solving the problem.
